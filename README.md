Common issues
Getting "Forbidden" error. (Even after refresh, the whole page just shows "Forbidden")
There is a chance that the API adding too fast and you hit the rate limit of the API. (My testing is around after 10 pages, so ~10k items).
Wait after ~10-20 minutes and continue. See to continue the execution after you can load https://quixel.com.Common Fixes -> Restart script
The script seems to be paused/hang
It could be too much logging going it. Try monitor the script, if it says "END PAGE X", note the page number down (in case need restart) and clear the console by clicking the "ðŸš«" icon in devtools.
